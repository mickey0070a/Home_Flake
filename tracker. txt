got nix with awesome deployment working and nix deployment for 3d printer working. 

planning on this file to help track the goals I am trying to reach for this project. as time goes I will mark things completed or abandoned in the header for each section. I will keep the goals if able or necessary to help track the development. will use fit commit as well for this endeavor.

need to do:

User Profiles:
I had to use GitHub to hijack luaRocks install to get the full freedesktop environment. I need to fix the loader to install Lain via luaRocks and got download to freedesktop. I also had to use symlinks to get awesome to recognize the folder path. I would like to automate this if possible and keep it under awesome. 

need to create a theme setter for each profile, so create a theme branch and get user ID to target that branch in awesome. also need to find out how to allow love updates without needing to rebuild each time.

ender3 Profile:
I have successful deployment of the ender 3 build, I need to learn how to use Moonraker, fluid, and klipper from cli

cerih profile:
I need to mimick how mine is setup but have a few changes to focus on what Ceri would use. 

for her theme I need to mimic how Google OS and windows is handled to keep familiarity. also probably desktop icons. 

server profile:
need to look up nix tools for a server that can be used, if I can use syncthing from cli, as well as allowing remote VIM. also allowing file exploration and connection automatically from the laptops. 

entertainment profile:
need to set it up and figure out how to beat use it.
